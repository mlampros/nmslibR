Description: A Non-Metric Space Library ('NMSLIB' <https://github.com/searchivarius/nmslib>) wrapper, which according to the authors "is an efficient cross-platform similarity search library and a toolkit for evaluation of similarity search methods. The goal of the 'NMSLIB' <https://github.com/searchivarius/nmslib> Library is to create an effective and comprehensive toolkit for searching in generic non-metric spaces. Being comprehensive is important, because no single method is likely to be sufficient in all cases. Also note that exact solutions are hardly efficient in high dimensions and/or non-metric spaces. Hence, the main focus is on approximate methods". The wrapper also includes Approximate Kernel k-Nearest-Neighbor functions based on the 'NMSLIB' <https://github.com/searchivarius/nmslib> 'Python' Library.
